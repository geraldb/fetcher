## Usage

### Copy (to File)

    Fetcher.copy( 'https://raw.github.com/openfootball/at-austria/master/2013_14/bl.txt', '/tmp/bl.txt' )

or

    worker = Fetcher::Worker.new
    worker.copy( 'https://raw.github.com/openfootball/at-austria/master/2013_14/bl.txt', '/tmp/bl.txt' )


### Read (into String)

    txt = Fetcher.read( 'https://raw.github.com/openfootball/at-austria/master/2013_14/bl.txt' )

or

    worker = Fetcher::Worker.new
    txt = worker.read( 'https://raw.github.com/openfootball/at-austria/master/2013_14/bl.txt' )

Note: The method `read` will return a string.


### Get (HTTP Response)

    response = Fetcher.get( 'https://raw.github.com/openfootball/at-austria/master/2013_14/bl.txt' )

or

    worker = Fetcher::Worker.new
    response = worker.get( 'https://raw.github.com/openfootball/at-austria/master/2013_14/bl.txt' )

Note: The method `get` will return a `Net::HTTPResponse` object
(lets you use code, headers, body, etc.).

    puts response.code             # => '404'
                                   #  Note: Returned (status) code is a string e.g. '404'
    puts response.message          # => 'Not Found'
    puts response.body
    puts response.content_type     # => 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
    puts response['content-type']  # => 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
                                   #  Note: Headers are always downcased
                                   #        e.g. use 'content-type' not 'Content-Type'
